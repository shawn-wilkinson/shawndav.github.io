          <h1>Chef's Kitchen</h1>
          <h3>Owning my experience at Dev Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>April 12, 2015</p>
          <p>I've just finished the first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp. The work so far has centered on setting up and becoming comfortable with the tools we'll use throughout the program: mainly Git, GitHub and the command line. It's time to take a breath, and get ready for what's to come. I know that DBC has an amazing curriculum, and that this is just the very beginning. After watching <a href ="https://vimeo.com/85001014">this video</a>, I've come to realize that what sets DBC apart, and what will truly drive my learning in the coming months, is the culture that has developed at DBC.</p>

          <p>At DBC you're expected to take ownership of your learning. This is not the place to simply pay your tuition, sit back and wait for it to happen. Dev Bootcamp provides the environment - the teachers, the curriculum, the colleagues, but I'm responsible for my own learning. In the video, Shereef likens this to being a chef in a kitchen: we're all in there working together to make something amazing happen. I might burn my hand on the stove or overcook something, but it's an active learning process, it's to be expected, and in the end I'll be a better cook - a better developer and colleague.</p>

          <p>I'm sure at many points throughout this process I'll be tired and discouraged at the difficulty and pace of the program. There will be frustrations. I will need to remember that it's all part of the experience, maintain a growth mindset and keep moving forward. At the end of the program, I may have learned more or less than others in my cohort, but the true measure of success is how much I have applied myself to this opportunity and how open and empathetic I've been in the process.</p>

          <p>The characteristics promoted by DBC serve as long-term assets for my professional and personal life. DBC places great value on soft skills like empathy, communication and self-awareness. The ability to relate to others, understand their perspective and communicate in a respectful way is key to success in all aspects of life.</p>
