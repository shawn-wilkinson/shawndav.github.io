          <h1>My "Concrete Random" Thinking Style:</h1>
          <h3>Independent, Expirimental and Intuitive</h3>
          <p>April 24, 2015</p>
          <p>In preparation for Dev Bootcamp, I was instructed to take a <a href = http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html>thinking style test</a>, and found out that I am a <em>Concrete Random Thinker</em>, which means that I enjoy "experimenting to find answers, taking risks, using my intuition and solving problems independently." To me, this description is spot-on. I enjoy experimenting independently to develop a deep understanding of a concept and place it in a larger context. I find it tedious to just sit down and read or memorize something. Looking back, I think this is likely what drew me to study German and Economics: they are both subjects where you can play around and experiment to develop a better understanding of the logical structure underneath. This is also what likely lead me to pursue coding.</p>
          <p>I think this thinking style will be a major asset at Dev Bootcamp and in my career as a developer. I am driven to explore and engage with a concept until I am satisfied that I understand the "why" and "how" behind it. This makes me a resourceful, independent learner and well-suited for understanding systems as a whole, finding optimizations and coming up with new approaches.</p>
          <p>It is true though that my thinking style will not be ideally suited for all tasks. I dislike routine or regimented tasks. To be a more well-rounded thinker and colleague, I will seek to build on my ability to think in a sequential, routinized manner when appropriate. I will do my best to maintain a growth mindset, and understand that these skills can be developed with practice.</p>
