          <h1>Organizing Information in Ruby</h1>
          <h3>An Introduction to Arrays and Hashes</h3>
          <p>April 26, 2015</p>
          <p>Arrays and Hashes are unique because they can actually <em>contain</em> other objects. They are useful for saving and organizing informaiton, and prove essential to programming in Ruby. Today I'm going give a very introductory overview of arrays, hashes and examples of how they can be used.</p>
          <p><strong>Arrays:</strong> Arrays can contain a group of objects in an ordered list. Each object in the arrays has a number, which makes arrays useful for maintaining order. For example, an array would be useful for keeping both a shopping list (where order doesn't matter) and names of people waiting for a table at a busy restaurant (where order matters). </p>
          <p><code> shopping_list = ["eggs","milk","coffee","ice cream","dog food"]</code></p>
          <p><code>waiting_list = ["Smith","Wilson","Cooper"]</code>
          <p>We can play with this a bit more. Instead of text, let's put an array inside of the our array <code>waiting_list</code>. For each of the families listed, we're going to include their last name, the number of people in their party and also a true / false to indicate if it's a special occasion.</p>
          <p><code> waiting_list = [ <br>
          ["Smith", 4, true], <br>
          ["Wilson", 2, false], <br>
          ["Cooper", 10, true]<br>
            ] </code></p>
          <p>As you can see within the main array, there are three different arrays. The Smith family is the first array. We can see that they have a party of four and they are celebrating something tonight. Arrays can get much more complex than this, but this gives you an idea as to useful and flexible they can be.</p>
          <p><strong>Hashes:</strong> Hashes are simmilar to Arrays in that they also contain other objects. While arrays contain an ordered list of individual objects, Hashes contain multiple pairs of "keys" and "values". The keys can help provide context for the information in value. For example, let's say you wanted to store information on all of your friend's favorite things. We could create a hash called <code>courtneys_favorites</code> and inside have "keys" (favorite color, favorite food, favorite movie) that correspond to "values" (blue, burritos, Reno 911). </p>
          <p><code>courtneys_favorites = { <br>
          "favorite color" => "blue", <br>
          "favorite food" => "burritos",<br>
          "favorite movie" => "Reno 911"<br>
          }</code></p>
          <p>In the code above, the key <code>favorite color</code> points to the value <code>blue</code>. This is very simple example of hashes can be useful for saving and providing context for information.</p>
          <p><strong>Mix It Up:</strong> Let's put hashes <em>inside</em> an array. Let's use the friend example, we're going to have an array of three of our friends. Each item in that array is going to be a hash. Inside each hash we are going to use keys and values to store each friend's name, their favorite food and their hometown.</p>
          <p><code>friends = [<br>
          {"name" => "Stephanie", "favorite food" => "fried pickles", "hometown" => "Atlanta"},<br>
          {"name" => "Nicole", "favorite food" => "ribbon candy", "hometown" => "Rochester"},<br>
          {"name" => "Leah", "favorite food" => "gyoza", "hometown" => "Seattle"}<br>
          ] </p>
          <p>As you can see, we have information about three friends stored in our <code>friends</code> array. Each friend has its own hash within the array. Very interesting stuff!</p>
          <p>You can see from these examples how useful both arrays and hashes can be, and how they can work together to organize information. </p>
