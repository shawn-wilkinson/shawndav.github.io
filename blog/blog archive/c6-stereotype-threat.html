          <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
          <h3>Reflections From My Perspective</h3>
          <p>May 17, 2015</p>
          <p>This week for Dev Bootcamp, we were asked to explore the topic of stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is when you are concerned that you are "at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" (<a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">Steele & Aronson, 1995</a>). This is particularly problematic when stereotypes associated with an identity (ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, political affiliation, etc.) paint someone in a negative light in professional or academic settings. In these situations, individuals often fear that they will "live up to" the reputation set by that stereotype. This concern can cause under-performance. </p>
          <p>As with anything, I can only speak from my personal perspective, which is that of a gay white male. There are very few stereotypes associated with my academic or professional performance as a result of my white, male identity. I can however speak to my experience as a gay man, and how stereotypes associated with this identity have impacted me. There are no strong stereotypes concerning gay men in professional or academic environments, so I don't experience stereotype threat the same way or to the extent others do - I'm just speaking from my experience.</p>
          <p>Being gay is a unique identity because it can be hidden. In professional and academic settings sexual orientation of any kind is seldom discussed, and the issue can be easily skirted. Others cannot hide their gender or ethnicity, but in most cases, it is up to me when and how to disclose my sexual orientation, if at all.</p>
          <p>In my personal life, where I am open and freely discuss my sexual orientation, I often come into contact with people that have never been friends or acquaintances with a gay man before. I often feel the unconscious pressure to "win them over" so their impression of gay men is positive. I feel like an ambassador, carrying the burden of proving the stereotypes of gay men wrong. Pretty heavy stuff. I try to "just be myself" but in the back of my mind there is a voice that says "don't be dramatic... don't be flamboyant...". This pressure to be accepted in social circles has never caused me a great deal of concern, but it is something that is always in the back of my mind.</p>
          <p>Gay men feel the need to defy stereotypes even within our own community. There is pressure to "act masculine" and be "straight acting". Nobody wants to be the "typical gay guy". This is a complex topic, and there are many perspectives on it, but I think to a certain extent it could be considered stereotype threat.</p>
          <p>In one of my previous jobs, I worked in an environment where about half of the male staff were gay. I was much more open with my personal life in this setting as I didn't feel that I would be tokenized. Even so, in this situation I experienced stereotype threat. One stereotype of gay men is that we are dramatic. Because of this, in situations where I would normally have a strong opinion, I felt the need to be overly "chill" and easygoing. I worked in a managerial role, so I needed to show that gay men could be strong, respected and effective leaders. I tempered my thoughts more than I would in a more traditional workplace, where I would typically keep my sexual orientation off the table. This concern likely held me back from being as effective as I could have been in my position.</p>

          <p>With the experiences I've had in mind, to then think about the stereotypes encountered by women and ethnic minorities, I could only imagine how they would feel and what experiences they've had.  </p>
