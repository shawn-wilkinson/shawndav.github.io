          <h1>My Values</h1>
          <h3>Affirming What's Important To Me</h3>
          <p>May 23, 2015</p>
          <p>Last week, I wrote a blog entry about <a href ="http://shawndav.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype-threat">stereotype threat</a>. Examining and affirming your values is said to be one way to
          <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself"> combat stereotype threat </a>. This being said, this week I would like to examine and remind myself of the values I consider to be the most important in my life, in an effort to combat stereotype threat, but more-so as a reflection exercise.</p>
          <p>After some thought, I've come up with a list of my eleven core values. I tried to limit it to ten, but couldn't do it. I guess that means I found the right ones. In no particular order, here they are:
            <ol>
            <li>Adventure</li>
            <li>Close Relationships</li>
            <li>Ambition</li>
            <li>Privacy</li>
            <li>Creativity</li>
            <li>Introspection</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Romance</li>
            <li>Economic Security</li>
            <li>Meaningful Work</li>
            <li>Health</li>
          </ol></p>
          <p>These are the values that have driven my life thus-far, and continue to bring me contentment and purpose. Two that stick out are adventure and close relationships.</p>
          <p>Adventure has been a huge driving force in my life, and has encouraged me to travel extensively and live abroad, in both Europe and Asia, for four years. Although I am definitely not a daredevil, I try to experience as much as I can and seek out life's little secrets.</p>
          <p>Close relationships with friends and family members are extremely important to me. I enjoy the memories, inside jokes and loyalty that close relationships bring. I value getting to know people on a deeper level, and have had the opportunity to do so with many people over my years and travels. Thinking on these people now, it makes me happy to reminisce but also long for a reunion with those I haven't seen recently.</p>
          <p>The last two times I was asked for advice, they were related to the values of close relationships and adventure. I was asked to review and provide feedback on a close friend's travel plans to Southeast Asia. I was also asked my opinion on how to handle an interpersonal issue. I'm glad that people I'm close with feel comfortable to come to me questions, especially when it is in relationship to my core values.
          <p>After reflecting on all of my core values, I think there is more I could be doing to make them a more significant part of my day-to-day life. I think this can be best accomplished by distilling the values down and finding ways to include them in my daily tasks. For example, I don't need to paint a portrait everyday to be creative, but I can apply creativity as I address daily tasks and approach problems.
          </p>
          <p>Moving forward, I will try to be more conscious about how I infuse these values into my life, both in terms of long-term planning and routine daily activities. It's not something to obsess over, but it is important to be conscious of as it can help drive a more fulfilling life, which is, of course, my ultimate goal.</p>
