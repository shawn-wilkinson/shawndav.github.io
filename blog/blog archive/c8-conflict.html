          <h1>Overcoming Conflict</h1>
          <h3>Tips and Reflection</h3>
          <p>May 31, 2015</p>
          <p>It was requested that I write a bit about conflict, its origins and ways to overcome it. In planning for this post, I've had the opportunity to reflect on the times I've experienced conflict, how I responded to it and encapsulate some best-practices for the future. It was also requested that I illustrate this by using a real conflict from my personal life as an example. Instead of doing this, I'm going to discuss some general realizations I've had:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Check Your Perspective:</strong> Opinions are based on each person's own perception of a situation. Perceptions are unique because each person has one. Before you jump to conclusions, it's a good idea to examine your understanding of a situation to see if there's another way of looking at things.</li>
          <li><strong>Own Your Feelings:</strong> Conflict can make us angry, annoyed and hurt. Instead of just getting swept up in these emotions, and allowing them to influence our actions and words, it is important to acknowledge them and identify the reason you're feeling them.</li>
          <li><strong>Fight the Urge be Defensive:</strong> With conflict comes criticism. Some of us are better than others at handling criticism. The same person may be more open to criticism in one aspect of their life and completely closed off in others. It is very easy to simply reflect someone's criticism by hurling negative comments back at them. This is dangerous because, by being defensive, people continue to fuel the conflict and completely write-off valuable information about the other person's perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge Their Opinions:</strong> Really listen to what other people are saying. Rephrase what they've said and repeat it back to make sure you understand their point. Reflect on and unpack what was said. What have you learned about their perspective? Does this change how you see something? Use this as a way to move the discussion forward in good faith. If you open up, it will encourage them to do the same.
          <li><strong>Build Common Ground:</strong> People typically want the same things. Two roommates want a peaceful living environment. Coworkers want to work efficiently and pleasantly. Couples want a harmonious relationship. Understand that the other person isn't just trying to be terrible to you. For the most part, people have good intentions. Find that common ground and work from it.</li>
          </ol>
