          <p>Version control software monitors and saves changes made to a file over time. Every time you save a file, a snapshot is taken and catalogued for future reference, with special attention paid to changes made to this file over previous versions. You may make additional changes, and many additional saves to the file, but each of those "snapshots" will be there for you to look back on. This is helpful in case there is a bug that needs to be identified, or a recent revision is now unwanted.</p>

          <p>Git is a common piece of version control software used by programmers. Git keeps its eyes on a set of files for you, and can tell you what changes have been made. You can update these changes to Git for future reference by submitting a "commit". Each commit is accompanied by a message describing what changes have been made and the reasoning behind them - which is particularly useful if you're working as a member of a team.</p>

          <p>In recent years, Git has been popularized by the website GitHub. GitHub is a centralized hub for git-tracked files. It enables a team to share and update the most recent version of the project, while at the same time monitoring the changes of each team member. Because it is so widely used, it is a great platform for receiving feedback from other developers, as well working on open source projects.</p>
