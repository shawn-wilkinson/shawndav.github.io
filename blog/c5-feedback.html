          <h1>Pair Programming</h1>
          <h3>Working Collaboratively and Offering Feedback</h3>
          <p>May 10, 2015</p>
          <p>Pair programming is an essential part of being a developer. It's a great way to learn from others and build a deeper understanding of the programming language. It also benefits the end product by decreasing errors and bringing multiple perspectives and strengths to the table. Successful pair programming requires respectful and clear communication and good listening skills.</p>
          <p>I pair program multiple times each week in my studies at Dev Bootcamp. It took me a few sessions to really get used to working on the same code with someone else. I'm naturally drawn to thinking things through and playing around with a problem on my own. Pair programming is helpful because it forces me to articulate my thoughts, identify ways to improve myself, and provides perspective on how others approach a problem.</p>
          <p>When I pair program with someone, I want to be able to provide actionable feedback, but sometimes it's difficult to come up with something more than "Good job - keep doing what you're doing". I try to come up with something useful to offer, but if there's nothing major to comment on sometimes I feel like I'm nit-picking. When this happens, I try to remember that, for all of us, there will always be someway to improve. Actionable feedback doesn't always have to be "stuff they're doing wrong", but suggestions or resources to help in their development.</p>
          <p>When receiving feedback, it's important to take it in the spirit it was given: as an offering to help you improve and not as a personal insult. Even though we may understand that we are not perfect, and recognize the ways in which we can improve, when someone else addresses it, it can be tempting to get down on yourself or become defensive. To counteract this, look at feedback as an opportunity to improve on yourself. Opening yourself up to criticism can make you feel vulnerable, but you will soon seek it out as an opportunity to identify and address your weaknesses.</p>
