    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Recursion: Finding Factorials Through Recursive Methods</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 31, 2015</p>
          <p>Recursion is when a function or method calls itself. Through recursion, a problem is solved by solving a series of smaller, similar problems. To demonstrate, let's solve the same problem twice: once without recursion and once with recursion.</p>
          <p>For our example, we're going to create a method that finds the factorial of an integer. The factorial of an integer is the product of that integer and every whole number less than it. In other words, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 and 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. The factorial of any number less than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 0 is 1. You cannot take the factorial of a negative number.</p>
          <p><strong>Without Recursion:</strong>
          <br><code>def factorial(num)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;product = 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;if num < 0<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 'You cannot take the factorial of a negative number.'<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;elsif num <= 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while num > 0<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product = product * num<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num = num - 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return product<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          end<br></code></p>
          <p><strong>With Recursion:</strong>
          <br><code>def recursive_factorial(num)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;if num < 0<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 'You cannot take the factorial of a negative number.'<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;elsif num <= 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num * recursive_factorial(num - 1)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          end<br></code></p>
          <p>Both of these methods return the exact same value. They just go about it in different ways. Without recursion, with the factorial method, we multiply numbers by a retained product value, starting at the value 'num' and decreasing by 1 until we reach 0. With recursion, when we call recurisve_factorial(num) we multiply 'num' time the value of recursive_factorial(num-1). This method basically calls itself multiple times until num = 1 and the base value of 1 is returned. This basically amounts to 5! = (5 x(4 x(3 x(2 x(1))))).</p>
          <p>Recursion is certainly not appropriate for every problem, but is useful in certain situations. In this case, recursion provides a more elegant, concise method to find the factorial of a number.</p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Overcoming Conflict: Tips and Reflection</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 31st, 2015</p>
          <p>It was requested that I write a bit about conflict, its origins and ways to overcome it. In planning for this post, I've had the opportunity to reflect on the times I've experienced conflict, how I responded to it and encapsulate some best-practices for the future. It was also requested that I illustrate this by using a real conflict from my personal life as an example. Instead of doing this, I'm going to discuss some general realizations I've had:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Check Your Perspective:</strong> Opinions are based on each person's own perception of a situation. Perceptions are unique because each person has one. Before you jump to conclusions, it's a good idea to examine your understanding of a situation to see if there's another way of looking at things.</li>
          <li><strong>Own Your Feelings:</strong> Conflict can make us angry, annoyed and hurt. Instead of just getting swept up in these emotions, and allowing them to influence our actions and words, it is important to acknowledge them and identify the reason you're feeling them.</li>
          <li><strong>Fight the Urge be Defensive:</strong> With conflict comes criticism. Some of us are better than others at handling criticism. The same person may be more open to criticism in one aspect of their life and completely closed off in others. It is very easy to simply reflect someone's criticism by hurling negative comments back at them. This is dangerous because, by being defensive, people continue to fuel the conflict and completely write-off valuable information about the other person's perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge Their Opinions:</strong> Really listen to what other people are saying. Rephrase what they've said and repeat it back to make sure you understand their point. Reflect on and unpack what was said. What have you learned about their perspective? Does this change how you see something? Use this as a way to move the discussion forward in good faith. If you open up, it will encourage them to do the same.
          <li><strong>Build Common Ground:</strong> People typically want the same things. Two roommates want a peaceful living environment. Coworkers want to work efficiently and pleasantly. Couples want a harmonious relationship. Understand that the other person isn't just trying to be terrible to you. For the most part, people have good intentions. Find that common ground and work from it.</li>
          </ol>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Ruby and JavaScript: Differences in If...Else Statements </h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 24th, 2015</p>
          <p>Until just recently, my studies at Dev Bootcamp have focused on Ruby, a popular object-oriented programming language. This past week, we've been introduced to JavaScript. Although Ruby and JavaScript are alike in many ways, they also have some major differences. In this blog post, I'd like to explore some of these differences by comparing how Ruby and JavaScript address if...else statements. </p>
          <p>Below you will see two if...else statements. They are identical except one is written in JavaScript and the other is in Ruby. Both are written to compare a user's score with an existing high score to determine if a new record has been set.</p>
          <p><strong>Ruby:</strong><br><code>
          user_score = 20<br>
          high_score = 10<br>

          if user_score > high_score<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Amazing! You set a new high score!"<br>
          elsif user_score == high_score<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Great job! You tied the high score!"<br>
          else<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Good job!"<br>
          end<br></code></p>


          <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong><br><code>
          var userScore = 20<br>
          var highScore = 10<br>
          if (userScore > highScore) {console.log("Amazing! You set a new high score!")}<br>
          else if(userScore === highScore){console.log("Great job! You tied the high score!")}<br>
          else{console.log("Good job!")};</code></p>
          <p>As you can see above, both Ruby and JavaScript utilize a similar structure. They both use <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>, while Ruby uses <code>elsif</code> and JavaScript uses <code>else if</code>. Beyond this, there are a number of differences.</p>
          <p>This first difference can be seen in the statement that is being evaluated. In ruby <code>if user_score > high_score</code> is used, while in JavaScript <code>If(userScore > highScore)</code> is used. JavaScript requires parenthesis to be used to contain the evaluated statement. After the statement is evaluated, the code block is also formatted differently in each of the two languages. In Ruby, the code between the line with the if and the line with the elsif will run in the event the if statement's condition is true. This code must be on a new line. In JavaScript this code does not need to be on a new line, but must be written inside curly brackets. To finish an if...else statement in Ruby an <code>end</code> is required, while in JavaScript only a semicolon is used.</p>

<div class="blogentry" id="values">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Affirming My Values</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
           <p>May 23rd, 2015</p>
          <p>Last week, I wrote a blog entry about <a href="#stereotype_threat">stereotype threat</a>. Examining and affirming your values is said to be one way to
          <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself"> combat stereotype threat </a>. This being said, this week I would like to examine and remind myself of the values I consider to be the most important in my life, in an effort to combat stereotype threat, but more-so as a reflection exercise.</p>
          <p>After some thought, I've come up with a list of my eleven core values. I tried to limit it to ten, but couldn't do it. I guess that means I found the right ones. In no particular order, here they are:
            <ol>
            <li>Adventure</li>
            <li>Close Relationships</li>
            <li>Ambition</li>
            <li>Privacy</li>
            <li>Creativity</li>
            <li>Introspection</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Romance</li>
            <li>Economic Security</li>
            <li>Meaningful Work</li>
            <li>Health</li>
          </ol></p>
          <p>These are the values that have driven my life thus-far, and continue to bring me contentment and purpose. Two that stick out are adventure and close relationships.</p>
          <p>Adventure has been a huge driving force in my life, and has encouraged me to travel extensively and live abroad, in both Europe and Asia, for four years. Although I am definitely not a daredevil, I try to experience as much as I can and seek out life's little secrets.</p>
          <p>Close relationships with friends and family members are extremely important to me. I enjoy the memories, inside jokes and loyalty that close relationships bring. I value getting to know people on a deeper level, and have had the opportunity to do so with many people over my years and travels. Thinking on these people now, it makes me happy to reminisce but also long for a reunion with those I haven't seen recently.</p>
          <p>The last two times I was asked for advice, they were related to the values of close relationships and adventure. I was asked to review and provide feedback on a close friend's travel plans to Southeast Asia. I was also asked my opinion on how to handle an interpersonal issue. I'm glad that people I'm close with feel comfortable to come to me questions, especially when it is in relationship to my core values.
          <p>After reflecting on all of my core values, I think there is more I could be doing to make them a more significant part of my day-to-day life. I think this can be best accomplished by distilling the values down and finding ways to include them in my daily tasks. For example, I don't need to paint a portrait everyday to be creative, but I can apply creativity as I address daily tasks and approach problems.
          </p>
          <p>Moving forward, I will try to be more conscious about how I infuse these values into my life, both in terms of long-term planning and routine daily activities. It's not something to obsess over, but it is important to be conscious of as it can help drive a more fulfilling life, which is, of course, my ultimate goal.</p>

     <div class="blogentry" id="variable_scope">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Variable Scope in Ruby</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 17th, 2015</p>
          <p>Programs can have a seemingly endless number of variables. How do you know, when you declare a variable called "number" that you aren't overwriting another variable by the same name somewhere else in the program? Variables would need increasingly obscure names to keep this from happening, which would in-turn make using these variables extremely confusing. Thankfully, there are different types of variables in Ruby, which helps to keep things in order. Each type of variable has a different scope, which limits where they are accessible in the program.</p>
          <p><strong>Local Variables:</strong> Local variables are accessible only within the method or loop that they are created. For this reason they are said to have a "local scope". Local variables must either begin with a lower case letter or an underscore: example_variable _example_variable.</p>
          <p><strong>Instance Variables:</strong> Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. For example, each instance of the employee class may have the variable @hourly_wage, but they each have their own unique value for it. Instance variables are only accessible through the object with which they are associated. Instance variables are easy to spot because they start with an "@": @variable_example, @student_gpa.</p>
          <p><strong>Class Variables:</strong> Class variables are common to all instances of a class. If one object of a class changes the value of a class variable, the value changes for all instance of that class. Class variables can be identified because they have two "@"s in front of them: @@temperature, @@class_variable.</p>
          <p><strong>Global Variables:</strong> Global variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program. This means that the value can not only be accessed and read, but it can also be changed from anywhere. This has its uses, but should be used with the understanding that it would be possible for the variable to mistakenly be changed from somewhere else in the program. Global variables can be identified by the dollar sign in front of their name: $global $revenue. </p>
          <p><strong>Constants:</strong> If declared within a class or module, the scope of that constants will be limited to that class or module. If declared outside of a class or module, constants will have a global scope. As they are "constants", once they are given a value, it should not be changed. The value <em>can</em> be changed, but you will get a warning message before it is changed. Constants are easy to spot because they are in all-caps: CONSTANT, EXAMPLE.</p>

     <div class="blogentry" id="stereotype_threat">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Stereotype Threat: Reflections From My Perspective</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 17th, 2015</p>
          <p>This week for Dev Bootcamp, we were asked to explore the topic of stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is when you are concerned that you are "at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" (<a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">Steele & Aronson, 1995</a>). This is particularly problematic when stereotypes associated with an identity (ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, political affiliation, etc.) paint someone in a negative light in professional or academic settings. In these situations, individuals often fear that they will "live up to" the reputation set by that stereotype. This concern can cause under-performance. </p>
          <p>As with anything, I can only speak from my personal perspective, which is that of a gay white male. There are very few stereotypes associated with my academic or professional performance as a result of my white, male identity. I can however speak to my experience as a gay man, and how stereotypes associated with this identity have impacted me. There are no strong stereotypes concerning gay men in professional or academic environments, so I don't experience stereotype threat the same way or to the extent others do - I'm just speaking from my experience.</p>
          <p>Being gay is a unique identity because it can be hidden. In professional and academic settings sexual orientation of any kind is seldom discussed, and the issue can be easily skirted. Others cannot hide their gender or ethnicity, but in most cases, it is up to me when and how to disclose my sexual orientation, if at all.</p>
          <p>In my personal life, where I am open and freely discuss my sexual orientation, I often come into contact with people that have never been friends or acquaintances with a gay man before. I often feel the unconscious pressure to "win them over" so their impression of gay men is positive. I feel like an ambassador, carrying the burden of proving the stereotypes of gay men wrong. Pretty heavy stuff. I try to "just be myself" but in the back of my mind there is a voice that says "don't be dramatic... don't be flamboyant...". This pressure to be accepted in social circles has never caused me a great deal of concern, but it is something that is always in the back of my mind.</p>
          <p>Gay men feel the need to defy stereotypes even within our own community. There is pressure to "act masculine" and be "straight acting". Nobody wants to be the "typical gay guy". This is a complex topic, and there are many perspectives on it, but I think to a certain extent it could be considered stereotype threat.</p>
          <p>In one of my previous jobs, I worked in an environment where about half of the male staff were gay. I was much more open with my personal life in this setting as I didn't feel that I would be tokenized. Even so, in this situation I experienced stereotype threat. One stereotype of gay men is that we are dramatic. Because of this, in situations where I would normally have a strong opinion, I felt the need to be overly "chill" and easygoing. I worked in a managerial role, so I needed to show that gay men could be strong, respected and effective leaders. I tempered my thoughts more than I would in a more traditional workplace, where I would typically keep my sexual orientation off the table. This concern likely held me back from being as effective as I could have been in my position.</p>

          <p>With the experiences I've had in mind, to then think about the stereotypes encountered by women and ethnic minorities, I could only imagine how they would feel and what experiences they've had.  </p>

     <div class="blogentry" id="ruby_class">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Ruby Classes and Objects</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 10th, 2015</p>
          <p>Classes allow you to create a basic template for a set of similar objects. For example, every time you create a new object of the "Car class" it would be able to do methods like "honk", "drive_forward" and "rev_engine". It would also have instance variables like @make, @model and @color. These are things all cars have in common (they may have different makes, but they all at least have). Every time you create a new Car object, it will "come with" these characteristics from the moment of initialization. If you're going to be creating a lot of "cars", this will save you a good deal of time and promote consistency among instances of the Car class.</p>
          <p> I'd like to play around with our Car class example, and introduce you to my car, "Suby" the green Subaru Outback...</p>
          <p><code>class Car<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(make,model,color,mpg)<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@make = make<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@model = model<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@color = color<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@mpg = mpg<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          end<br><br>
          Suby = Car.new('Subaru','Outback','green',27)</code></p>
          <p>In the above code I first creating the Car class. I then go on to define the initialization method (used to create new instances of the Car class). The initialization method requires four parameters: make, model, color and MPG. Below this, after I've closed the class, you can see that I'm creating a new instance of the Car class called Suby. For the initialization parameters, I pass use the values of 'Subaru', 'Outback', 'green' and 27. We can create a second car just as easily. </p>
          <p><code> Simon = Car.new('Honda','Civic','blue',34) <br><br>
            class Car<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def basic_info<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "This is a #{@color} #{@make} #{@model} that gets #{@mpg} MPG."<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          end<br><br>
          Suby.basic_info<br>
          Simon.basic_info</code></p>
          <p>You can see above that we added "Simon", a new instance of the Car class. After entering Simon's information, we went on to define a new method for the Car class, basic_info. This method displays a sentence with information about the car. Below this, we then called this basic_info method on both Suby and Simon. This results in the below output.</p>
          <p><code>This is a green Subaru Outback that gets 27 MPG.<br>
          This is a blue Honda Civic that gets 34 MPG.</code></p>
          <p>You can see that both Suby and Simon have their own values for @make, @model, @color and @mpg. This is because these are instance variables. Each <em>instance</em> of the Car class (Suby and Simon are each an <em>instance</em>) has their own value for each instance variables. Instance variables are easy to spot because they have an '@' in front of the variable name.</p>
          <p>This is a very basic example of how to use classes in Ruby, but I hope it was helpful. There is a lot more to discuss, so hopefully I'll be able to address it in a future blog post.</p>

      <div class="blogentry" id="pair_programming">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Pair Programming: How to Collaborate and Offer Feedback</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 10th, 2015</p>
          <p>Pair programming is an essential part of being a developer. It's a great way to learn from others and build a deeper understanding of the programming language. It also benefits the end product by decreasing errors and bringing multiple perspectives and strengths to the table. Successful pair programming requires respectful and clear communication and good listening skills.</p>
          <p>I pair program multiple times each week in my studies at Dev Bootcamp. It took me a few sessions to really get used to working on the same code with someone else. I'm naturally drawn to thinking things through and playing around with a problem on my own. Pair programming is helpful because it forces me to articulate my thoughts, identify ways to improve myself, and provides perspective on how others approach a problem.</p>
          <p>When I pair program with someone, I want to be able to provide actionable feedback, but sometimes it's difficult to come up with something more than "Good job - keep doing what you're doing". I try to come up with something useful to offer, but if there's nothing major to comment on sometimes I feel like I'm nit-picking. When this happens, I try to remember that, for all of us, there will always be someway to improve. Actionable feedback doesn't always have to be "stuff they're doing wrong", but suggestions or resources to help in their development.</p>
          <p>When receiving feedback, it's important to take it in the spirit it was given: as an offering to help you improve and not as a personal insult. Even though we may understand that we are not perfect, and recognize the ways in which we can improve, when someone else addresses it, it can be tempting to get down on yourself or become defensive. To counteract this, look at feedback as an opportunity to improve on yourself. Opening yourself up to criticism can make you feel vulnerable, but you will soon seek it out as an opportunity to identify and address your weaknesses.</p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>The Map Method: Easy Data Transformation</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 3rd, 2015</p>
          <p>I'm impressed with the amount of useful tools and shortcuts that are built into  Ruby. Enumerable methods, which allow you to modify or sort large amounts of data, are some of the most powerful. For this blog post, I'm going to discuss what I consider to be the most useful enumerable method, the map method.</p>
          <p>The map method allows you to transform large sets of data in a way of your choosing. For example, if you have an old array full of numbers, and you'd like to create a new array, where all the values are one greater than in the old array, you can do that with a map method.</p>
          <p><code>old_array = [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
          new_array = old_array.map{|x| x + 1}<br>
          => [2, 3, 4, 5]</code></p>
          <p>Each element in new_array is one greater than the corresponding element in old_array. The map method can also be used on strings. Let's say we have an array of names. The names are inconsistently capitalized and we want to standardize it so only the first letter of each name is capitalized. We can do this by using the map method and the string capitalize method. </p>
          <p><code>name_array = ['AmY','NORa','anthony','BRAD','CaRsOn'] <br>
          name_array.map {|name| name.capitalize} <br>
          => ["Amy", "Nora", "Anthony", "Brad", "Carson"]</code></p>
          <p>So we've seen that the map method can be used to transform both integers and strings that are stored in arrays. Follow along with me and let's try something a little more complicated. Here's the scenario: we're traveling to Thailand for vacation and we need to know the price of hotels. We're comparing five different hotels. Their names and prices are stored in the hash hotel_prices_thb below. The only problem is that these prices are all in Thai Baht (THB). As we're not familiar with this currency, let's use the map method to convert all the prices to US Dollars.</p>
          <p><code>hotel_prices_thb = {<br>
          'Hilton' => 3000,<br>
          'Banyan Tree' => 3500,<br>
          'Intercontinental' => 4500,<br>
          'Four Seasons' => 4700,<br>
          'St. Regis' => 5000<br>
          }
          usd_prices = hotel_prices_thb.map{|k,v| v / 33} <br>
          => [96, 112, 145, 151, 161] </code></p>
          <p>If you look above, we're using the same map method to convert the values of each pair in the array. We're taking the value and dividing it by 33 to convert from Thai Baht to US Dollars. This leaves us with an array of numbers. Each number represents the price in US Dollars of each hotel as it appears in the initial hash. This is just a basic transformation of a small handful of data. As you can imagine, for very large sets of data, this tool could be very handy!</p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women in Tech</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>May 3rd, 2015</p>
          <p>Despite the opportunity and energy of the tech industry, as with most fields, it is not without its issues. One of the most striking is the under representation of women in the tech workforce.</p>
          <p>Diverse perspectives bring strength to any organization, and with a disproportionately low level of female workers, the tech industry is at a disadvantage as a whole. In a <a href = "https://www.ncwit.org/resources/what-impact-gender-diversity-technology-business-performance-research-summary">2014 report,</a> The National Center for Women and Information Technology identifies the benefits of a gender-balanced workplace, including increased productivity and organizational performance.</p>

          <p>So, where do we go from here? How do we promote and encourage women in the tech industry? Fast Company outlines <a href ="http://www.fastcompany.com/3041339/strong-female-lead/10-commitments-that-will-make-a-difference-in-increasing-diversity-in-tec"><em>10 Actionable Ways to Actually Increase Diversity in Tech</em></a>, which include managers publicly demonstrating support and learning how to remove unconscious biases. In the workplace, I think these are good places to start. I feel though that exclusion of women from careers in the tech industry starts at a much earlier age. This needs to be addressed as well.</p>
          <p>I think the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry is related to a broader issue: the lack of tech education in schools. In a society with lingering (and still very strong) gender stereotypes, the idea that STEM careers are more "appropriate" for men is present even among children. Our public education system has a unique opportunity -and responsibility- to expose young children, and especially girls, to science, math and computer programming and present them as viable and exciting future career paths. In this regard, I think our schools are missing the mark.</p>
          <p>Having gone to public high school in upstate New York, I think back on my own experience and exposure to technology at this age. I took two years of mandatory "technology" classes. I learned how to make a wooden bear and a cookbook holder with a band-saw - your typical "shop" classes without any inclusion of computer sciences whatsoever. To be fair, I did periodically take typing classes in 4th and 5th grade. I also took a half year of computer programing my freshman year of high school. We wrote very simple programs and I remember enjoying it. This was an elective though, and I ended up taking it out of my own interest. All but a small handful of students, those that had a preexisting interest and self-selected into the class themselves left my high school without any exposure to computer programing. This means that, for the most-part, no students were introduced to computer programing as a career path that didn't seek it out themselves.</p>
          <p>Our public education system needs to do a better job of exposing students to computer programing at a young age. Unfortunately, as curriculum decisions are typically made at a local level, and with the limited budgets of many districts, substantive inclusion of computer programing in public education will likely take strong national leadership or enough time for the educational system to catch up.</p>

<div class="blogentry" id="ruby_array_hash">
    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Organizing Information in Ruby: Arrays and Hashes</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>April 26th, 2015</p>
          <p>Arrays and Hashes are unique because they can actually <em>contain</em> other objects. They are useful for saving and organizing information, and prove essential to programming in Ruby. Today I'm going give a very introductory overview of arrays, hashes and examples of how they can be used.</p>
          <p><strong>Arrays:</strong> Arrays can contain a group of objects in an ordered list. Each object in the arrays has a number, which makes arrays useful for maintaining order. For example, an array would be useful for keeping both a shopping list (where order doesn't matter) and names of people waiting for a table at a busy restaurant (where order matters). </p>
          <p><code> shopping_list = ["eggs","milk","coffee","ice cream","dog food"]</code></p>
          <p><code>waiting_list = ["Smith","Wilson","Cooper"]</code>
          <p>We can play with this a bit more. Instead of text, let's put an array inside of our array <code>waiting_list</code>. For each of the families listed, we're going to include their last name, the number of people in their party and also a true / false to indicate if it's a special occasion.</p>
          <p><code> waiting_list = [ <br>
          ["Smith", 4, true], <br>
          ["Wilson", 2, false], <br>
          ["Cooper", 10, true]<br>
            ] </code></p>
          <p>As you can see within the main array, there are three different arrays. The Smith family is the first array. We can see that they have a party of four and they are celebrating something tonight. Arrays can get much more complex than this, but this gives you an idea as to useful and flexible they can be.</p>
          <p><strong>Hashes:</strong> Hashes are similar to Arrays in that they also contain other objects. While arrays contain an ordered list of individual objects, Hashes contain multiple pairs of "keys" and "values". The keys can help provide context for the information in value. For example, let's say you wanted to store information on all of your friend's favorite things. We could create a hash called <code>courtneys_favorites</code> and inside have "keys" (favorite color, favorite food, favorite movie) that correspond to "values" (blue, burritos, Reno 911). </p>
          <p><code>courtneys_favorites = { <br>
          "favorite color" => "blue", <br>
          "favorite food" => "burritos",<br>
          "favorite movie" => "Reno 911"<br>
          }</code></p>
          <p>In the code above, the key <code>favorite color</code> points to the value <code>blue</code>. This is very simple example of hashes can be useful for saving and providing context for information.</p>
          <p><strong>Mix It Up:</strong> Let's put hashes <em>inside</em> an array. Let's use the friend example, we're going to have an array of three of our friends. Each item in that array is going to be a hash. Inside each hash we are going to use keys and values to store each friend's name, their favorite food and their hometown.</p>
          <p><code>friends = [<br>
          {"name" => "Stephanie", "favorite food" => "fried pickles", "hometown" => "Atlanta"},<br>
          {"name" => "Nicole", "favorite food" => "ribbon candy", "hometown" => "Rochester"},<br>
          {"name" => "Leah", "favorite food" => "gyoza", "hometown" => "Seattle"}<br>
          ] </p>
          <p>As you can see, we have information about three friends stored in our <code>friends</code> array. Each friend has its own hash within the array. Very interesting stuff!</p>
          <p>You can see from these examples how useful both arrays and hashes can be, and how they can work together to organize information. </p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>My Thinking Style</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>April 24th, 2015</p>
          <p>In preparation for Dev Bootcamp, I was instructed to take a <a href = http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html>thinking style test</a>, and found out that I am a <em>Concrete Random Thinker</em>, which means that I enjoy "experimenting to find answers, taking risks, using my intuition and solving problems independently." To me, this description is spot-on. I enjoy experimenting independently to develop a deep understanding of a concept and place it in a larger context. I find it tedious to just sit down and read or memorize something. Looking back, I think this is likely what drew me to study German and Economics: they are both subjects where you can play around and experiment to develop a better understanding of the logical structure underneath. This is also what likely lead me to pursue coding.</p>
          <p>I think this thinking style will be a major asset at Dev Bootcamp and in my career as a developer. I am driven to explore and engage with a concept until I am satisfied that I understand the "why" and "how" behind it. This makes me a resourceful, independent learner and well-suited for understanding systems as a whole, finding optimizations and coming up with new approaches.</p>
          <p>This thinking style comes with its drawbacks. Looking back on my first three weeks of Dev Bootcamp, I see that some of the biggest difficulties I've had are due in part to my "Concrete Random" thinking style. As is characteristic of this style, I love really digging into concepts. This means that sometimes I can get too involved in and spend too much time on one aspect of a problem. Good strategies to counteract this would be the <a href ="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">the pomodoro technique</a> and <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">time boxing</a>. To be a more well-rounded thinker and colleague, I will do my best to maintain a growth mindset, and understand that these skills can be developed with practice.</p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>HTML and CSS: Margins, Borders and Padding</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>April 19th, 2015</p>
            <p>CSS is a powerful tool for adding style and form to a website. Colors, borders, font size and style, placement of images and text - all of these can be customized to your liking through CSS. This blog will focus on three of the most fundamental attributes that can be modified using CSS: border, padding and margin.</p>

            <p><br>

            <div id="blogtextleft" ><p><strong>BORDER:</strong> As you might expect, the border is the area around the outside of an object. You can modify it's weight (how wide the line is), type (solid, dashed, etc.) and color. In our example, we will modify the border of a yellow square to make three distinct variations:
              <br><br>1.<code>border:10px solid red</code>
              <br><br>2.<code>border:2px dashed aqua</code>
              <br><br>3.<code>border:10px double lime</code>
              <br><br>These three lines of code create the three squares seen on the right. The first has a solid red line that is 10 pixels wide. The second is a dashed, 2-pixel-thick aqua border. The third box has a double-lined lime border that its 10 pixels wide. It's easy to see the variations that could be made. You can use many of the standard colors by name (red, green, blue, etc.), or - what's more fun- you can use a <a href = "https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">HEX color code</a>. </p>
              <br><br><img src="marginexample.png"/>
            </div>
            <div id="blogtextright">
              <img src="borderexample.png"/>
              <p><strong>MARGIN:</strong> Margin measures the distance around an object on four sides: top, right, bottom and left. In the image on the left, you can see that the red square is inside a grey box(which we can pretend is a website). The black lines represent the margin for each of the four directions. You can see that they are not always the same. In this picture, the top and left margins are less than the right and bottom margins. If you wanted to specify that the object should be <em>centered</em> on the page, the margins should all have the same value or at least each opposite pair (top and bottom, left and right) should.
              You can enter margins two ways:
              <br><br><code>margin: 10px</code>
              <br>This way sets a 10 pixel margin on all four sides of the object.
              <br><br><code>margin: 10px 5px 15px 2px</code>
              <br>This sets a 10pixel margin on the top, a 5 pixel margin on the right, a 15 pixel margin on the bottom and a 2 pixel margin on the left.</p>
              <p><strong>PADDING:</strong> In the picture to the left, the grey box <em>contains</em> the red square. This grey box has a minimum amount of space it sets as "padding" between its border and the red square. This represented by the black lines. The purpose of padding is to "breathing room" to content. For example, the paragraph you're reading now is inside a box with padding, otherwise the words would run right up against the box. Padding is written:

              <br><br><code>padding: 10px</code>
              <br>This sets 10 pixels of padding all around the inside of the box
              <br><br><code>padding: 10px 5px 15px 2px</code>
              <br>This sets 10pixels of padding on top, 5 on the right, 15 on bottom and 2 on the left.
              </p>

          <p>Version control software monitors and saves changes made to a file over time. Every time you save a file, a snapshot is taken and catalogued for future reference, with special attention paid to changes made to this file over previous versions. You may make additional changes, and many additional saves to the file, but each of those "snapshots" will be there for you to look back on. This is helpful in case there is a bug that needs to be identified, or a recent revision is now unwanted.</p>

          <p>Git is a common piece of version control software used by programmers. Git keeps its eyes on a set of files for you, and can tell you what changes have been made. You can update these changes to Git for future reference by submitting a "commit". Each commit is accompanied by a message describing what changes have been made and the reasoning behind them - which is particularly useful if you're working as a member of a team.</p>

          <p>In recent years, Git has been popularized by the website GitHub. GitHub is a centralized hub for git-tracked files. It enables a team to share and update the most recent version of the project, while at the same time monitoring the changes of each team member. Because it is so widely used, it is a great platform for receiving feedback from other developers, as well working on open source projects.</p>

    <div class="blogheader"><h1>Chef's Kitchen: Owning My Experience at DBC</h1></div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
          <p>April 12th, 2015</p>
          <p>I've just finished the first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp. The work so far has centered on setting up and becoming comfortable with the tools we'll use throughout the program: mainly Git, GitHub and the command line. It's time to take a breath, and get ready for what's to come. I know that DBC has an amazing curriculum, and that this is just the very beginning. After watching <a href ="https://vimeo.com/85001014">this video</a>, I've come to realize that what sets DBC apart, and what will truly drive my learning in the coming months, is the culture that has developed at DBC.</p>

          <p>At DBC you're expected to take ownership of your learning. This is not the place to simply pay your tuition, sit back and wait for it to happen. Dev Bootcamp provides the environment - the teachers, the curriculum, the colleagues, but I'm responsible for my own learning. In the video, Shereef likens this to being a chef in a kitchen: we're all in there working together to make something amazing happen. I might burn my hand on the stove or overcook something, but it's an active learning process, it's to be expected, and in the end I'll be a better cook - a better developer and colleague.</p>

          <p>I'm sure at many points throughout this process I'll be tired and discouraged at the difficulty and pace of the program. There will be frustrations. I will need to remember that it's all part of the experience, maintain a growth mindset and keep moving forward. At the end of the program, I may have learned more or less than others in my cohort, but the true measure of success is how much I have applied myself to this opportunity and how open and empathetic I've been in the process.</p>

          <p>The characteristics promoted by DBC serve as long-term assets for my professional and personal life. DBC places great value on soft skills like empathy, communication and self-awareness. The ability to relate to others, understand their perspective and communicate in a respectful way is key to success in all aspects of life.</p>
