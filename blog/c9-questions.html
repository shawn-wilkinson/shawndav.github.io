          <h1>How To Ask The Perfect Question</h1>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>June 3, 2015</p>
          <p>We've been asking questions since we first learned to speak. You'd think then that we would be better at asking them.

          Simple questions are easy enough "Where is Pine Street?" and "How much for a large drip coffee?" are both easy questions to understand. The problem lies in asking more complicated questions, where the assumptions surrounding the question are not widely shared or defined and the topic itself is more complex. If a question is improperly phrased, the likelyhood increases that we will get a response that doesn't adress what we'd like it to, that is if we get any response at all.

          With this in mind, I've collected some best practices for asking questions.

          1. Do Research: Has this question alreay been asked? Save everyone some time and check into this first. Has a similiar question been asked, but the answer doesn't apply to your situation? Use this insight to better isolate the problem you would like to address.

          2. Write A Good Title: Try your best to accurately summarize your problem in a concise, attention-getting title. Be specific and engaging. Here are some good and bad examples I stole form <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>:
          <ul>
          <li>Bad: C# Math Confusion</li>
          <li>Good: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?</li>
          <li>Bad: [php] session doubt</li>
          <li>Good: How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?</li>
          <li>Bad: android if else problems</li>
          <li>Good: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?</li>
          </ul>





          For reference, and your further exploration, I used resources from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>
