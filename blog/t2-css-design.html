            <h1>Website Design Basics With CSS</h1>
            <h3>Margins, Borders and Padding</h3>
            <p>April 19, 2015</p>
            <br>
            <p>CSS is a powerful tool for adding style and form to a website. Colors, borders, font size and style, placement of images and text - all of these can be customized to your liking through CSS. This blog will focus on three of the most fundamental attributes that can be modified using CSS: border, padding and margin.</p>

            <p><br>

            <div id="blogtextleft" ><p><strong>BORDER:</strong> As you might expect, the border is the area around the outside of an object. You can modify it's weight (how wide the line is), type (solid, dashed, etc.) and color. In our example, we will modify the border of a yellow square to make three distinct variations:
              <br><br>1.<code>border:10px solid red</code>
              <br><br>2.<code>border:2px dashed aqua</code>
              <br><br>3.<code>border:10px double lime</code>
              <br><br>These three lines of code create the three squares seen on the right. The first has a solid red line that is 10 pixels wide. The second is a dashed, 2-pixel-thick aqua border. The third box has a double-lined lime border that its 10 pixels wide. It's easy to see the variations that could be made. You can use many of the standard colors by name (red, green, blue, etc.), or - what's more fun- you can use a <a href = "https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">HEX color code</a>. </p>

              <p><strong>MARGIN:</strong> Margin measures the distance around an object on four sides: top, right, bottom and left. In the image on the left, you can see that the red square is inside a grey box(which we can pretend is a website). The black lines represent the margin for each of the four directions. You can see that they are not always the same. In this picture, the top and left margins are less than the right and bottom margins. If you wanted to specify that the object should be <em>centered</em> on the page, the margins should all have the same value or at least each opposite pair (top and bottom, left and right) should.
              You can enter margins two ways:
              <br><br><code>margin: 10px</code>
              <br>This way sets a 10 pixel margin on all four sides of the object.
              <br><br><code>margin: 10px 5px 15px 2px</code>
              <br>This sets a 10pixel margin on the top, a 5 pixel margin on the right, a 15 pixel margin on the bottom and a 2 pixel margin on the left.</p>
              <p><strong>PADDING:</strong> In the picture to the left, the grey box <em>contains</em> the red square. This grey box has a minimum amount of space it sets as "padding" between its border and the red square. This represented by the black lines. The purpose of padding is to "breathing room" to content. For example, the paragraph you're reading now is inside a box with padding, otherwise the words would run right up against the box. Padding is written:

              <br><br><code>padding: 10px</code>
              <br>This sets 10 pixels of padding all around the inside of the box
              <br><br><code>padding: 10px 5px 15px 2px</code>
              <br>This sets 10pixels of padding on top, 5 on the right, 15 on bottom and 2 on the left.
