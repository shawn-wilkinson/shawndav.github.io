          <h1>Gender Diversity in the Tech Workforce</h1>
          <h3>Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women</h3>
          <p>May 3, 2015</p>
          <p>Despite the opportunity and energy of the tech industry, as with most fields, it is not without its issues. One of the most striking is the under representation of women in the tech workforce.</p>
          <p>Diverse perspectives bring strength to any organization, and with a disproportionately low level of female workers, the tech industry is at a disadvantage as a whole. In a <a href = "https://www.ncwit.org/resources/what-impact-gender-diversity-technology-business-performance-research-summary">2014 report,</a> The National Center for Women and Information Technology identifies the benefits of a gender-balanced workplace, including increased productivity and organizational performance.</p>

          <p>So, where do we go from here? How do we promote and encourage women in the tech industry? Fast Company outlines <a href ="http://www.fastcompany.com/3041339/strong-female-lead/10-commitments-that-will-make-a-difference-in-increasing-diversity-in-tec"><em>10 Actionable Ways to Actually Increase Diversity in Tech</em></a>, which include managers publicly demonstrating support and learning how to remove unconscious biases. In the workplace, I think these are good places to start. I feel though that exclusion of women from careers in the tech industry starts at a much earlier age. This needs to be addressed as well.</p>
          <p>I think the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry is related to a broader issue: the lack of tech education in schools. In a society with lingering (and still very strong) gender stereotypes, the idea that STEM careers are more "appropriate" for men is present even among children. Our public education system has a unique opportunity -and responsibility- to expose young children, and especially girls, to science, math and computer programming and present them as viable and exciting future career paths. In this regard, I think our schools are missing the mark.</p>
          <p>Having gone to public high school in upstate New York, I think back on my own experience and exposure to technology at this age. I took two years of mandatory "technology" classes. I learned how to make a wooden bear and a cookbook holder with a band-saw - your typical "shop" classes without any inclusion of computer sciences whatsoever. To be fair, I did periodically take typing classes in 4th and 5th grade. I also took a half year of computer programing my freshman year of high school. We wrote very simple programs and I remember enjoying it. This was an elective though, and I ended up taking it out of my own interest. All but a small handful of students, those that had a preexisting interest and self-selected into the class themselves left my high school without any exposure to computer programing. This means that, for the most-part, no students were introduced to computer programing as a career path that didn't seek it out themselves.</p>
          <p>Our public education system needs to do a better job of exposing students to computer programing at a young age. Unfortunately, as curriculum decisions are typically made at a local level, and with the limited budgets of many districts, substantive inclusion of computer programing in public education will likely take strong national leadership or enough time for the educational system to catch up.</p>
